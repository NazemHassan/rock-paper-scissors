This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built in C++ as a beginner project.
The program allows a human player to compete against the computer over multiple rounds, keeps track of results, and announces the final winner.

  ## Purpose:
  This project is mainly for practicing:
  - Basic C++ syntax
  - enum and struct usage
  - Functions and parameter passing
  - Random number generation
  - Input validation and loops
